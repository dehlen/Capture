Capture is a native macOS application to record your screen. What makes this application special is, that you can choose from a list of currently open windows and Capture will automatically set the recorded frame to the window frame. The application also works for multiple displays and gives you a handful of useful features concerning the export, quality of the recorded video and more. By default Capture will export to GIF. 

I wrote this application because at my workplace we often attach a GIF to a Pull Request in order to present a completed feature to the reviewers.

## Caveats
- Currently only GIF export is allowed
- Stopping a recording is not possible via a menu item [üë®‚Äçüíª available in develop]
- There is no way to specify audio sources
- You can only select an open window. The selected recording frame is not resizable. [üë®‚Äçüíª available in develop]

## Dependencies

| Dependency    | Are           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Clipy/KeyHolder, Clipy/Magnet | Used to record shortcuts. |
| matthewpalmer/Regift     | Used to export a video as GIF. |
| mxcl/PromiseKit, PromiseKit/Foundation | Dependencies of AppUpdater which is currently not Carthage compatible. AppUpdater is used to provide automatic app updates. |
| dehlen/AboutWindowController | Not really a dependency since I own this one. AboutWindowController is used to show a nice Xcode-like About window. |

## Build
To setup the project just run rake setup. This will install all the needed dependencies. After that you can open the Xcode project. There is also rake setup_with_unit_test which executes the unit tests after installing the needed tools. 

Furthermore the project will run [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) as a Custom Build Phase. We also make use of [fastlane](https://fastlane.tools) to run the unit test target.
