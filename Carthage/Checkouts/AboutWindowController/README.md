# AboutWindowFramework
Swift clone of PFAboutWindow

### PFAboutWindow
[PFAboutWindow](https://github.com/perfaram/PFAboutWindow) is a Objective-C-Only library which provides a pretty designed About-Window for your application. Is is super easy to show credits, eula and copyright information in a great looking window which is oriented on Xcode6's About-Window design.

### Purpose
Since there was no Swift version of this library I thought I'd convert it by myself. You can find a Swift clone of PFAboutWindow in this repository. Also the .xib file was migrated to use AutoLayout. Everything is supported except for localizing the Buttons. If you need to localize the buttons you have to add it by yourself by creating a Localizable.strings file. Feel free to add it on your own and create a pull request !

### Version
1.5.7

### Screenshots
Before you download/install the application you can get a little sneak peek by looking at this screenshots:

### Installation/Usage

This library can be installed via Carthage:

```
github "dehlen/AboutWindowController"
```

Then just add it to your project like so:

```swift
import AboutWindowFramework

lazy var aboutWindowControllerConfig: AboutWindowControllerConfig = {
    let website = URL(string: "https://github.com/T-Rex-Editor")
   
    return AboutWindowControllerConfig(name: "App Name", version: nil, copyright: nil, credits: nil, creditsButtonTitle: "Credits", eula: nil, eulaButtonTitle: "EULA", url: website, hasShadow: true)
}()

lazy var aboutWindowController: AboutWindowController = {
    return AboutWindowController.create(with: aboutWindowControllerConfig)
}()

@IBAction func showAboutWindow(_ sender:AnyObject) {
    aboutWindowController.showWindow(self)
}

```

Next connect the IBAction `showAboutWindow` with the About menu entry or some button you want.

You can configure the screen with `AboutWindowControllerConfig`. However there are some defaults you might want to use:

| Property      | Default           
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Name      	   | **kCFBundleNameKey** |
| Version       | Version \(**CFBundleShortVersionString**) (Build \(**CFBundleVersion**))      |
| EULA 	      | **EULA.rtf** in your app bundle      |
| Credits 	   | **Credits.rtf** in your app bundle     |
| Copyright 	   | **NSHumanReadableCopyright**     |
| Credits Button 	   | Acknowledgments     |
| EULA Button 	   | License Agreement    |
| Window Shadow 	   | on     |
