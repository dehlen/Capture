# DEPRECATED

THe promises provided here are not-sensible. You should use a full delegate pattern for CoreBluetooth, one shot listening for connectivity is not wise since the accessory may disconnect at any time.

# PromiseKit CoreBluetooth Extensions ![Build Status]

This project adds promises to Appleâ€™s CoreBluetooth framework.

## CocoaPods

```ruby
pod "PromiseKit/CoreBluetooth" ~> 6.0
```

The extensions are built into `PromiseKit.framework` thus nothing else is needed.

## Carthage

```ruby
github "PromiseKit/CoreBluetooth" ~> 3.0
```

The extensions are built into their own framework:

```swift
// swift
import PromiseKit
import PMKCoreBluetooth
```

```objc
// objc
@import PromiseKit;
@import PMKCoreBluetooth;
```
